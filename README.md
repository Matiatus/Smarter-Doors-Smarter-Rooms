## Project Overview
According to student observations, energy is used unnecessarily upon buildings whose population change dramatically from dat to night. In order to make energy plannings according to the usage of common areas and also automating the built in systems, I cam up with the solution to install simple but effective arduino circuits to doors and solve couple of issues at the same time without disturbing people's daily routines. One is automating the build in building systems; other one is to collect data of usage for further plans and last but not least possible instanteneous monitor of rooms will help identify where people are located in case of emergency.
